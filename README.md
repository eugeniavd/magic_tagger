# MagicTagger: Open Infrastructure for Computational Analysis of Russian Folktales

**MagicTagger** is an early-stage research prototype for folklorists and DH researchers.  
It provides ATU Top-3 suggestions for Russian-language folktale texts and reproducible Linked Data exports (JSON-LD) with lightweight provenance (PROV-O) and a clear governance trail (model vs expert decision).

> **Status:** work in progress (research prototype).  
> Exports are downloaded explicitly by the user.

## 1. Goal

Provide a small, self-contained workbench that allows a researcher to:

- explore a curated corpus of Russian-language folktales ,
- obtain Top-3 ATU type suggestions** for an external Russian text,
- optionally override the model decision and export the final decision with provenance,
- export LOD-ready packages (JSON-LD per run / item; additional serializations for reuse).

The emphasis is on reproducibility (versioned corpus, stable label-set/policy pointers, dataset snapshot identifiers).

## 2. Licensing

MagicTagger distinguishes between **archival source materials**, **derived data**, and **code**.

- **Archival source materials (Estonian Folklore Archives)**:  
  The original materials are provided by the Estonian Folklore Archives and remain under the archive’s rights and access conditions. Some source-derived records may be flagged as `restricted_anon` via `dcterms:accessRights`; these restrictions reflect source constraints and must be respected in any reuse.

  Until the archive issues a decision on public disclosure of personal names, narrators and collectors are published in pseudonymised form. Person entries expose stable pseudonymous IDs (e.g., nar002, col056) and non-identifying attributes only. The name mapping table is held by the authors and is not shipped in this repository or exports. 

- **Derived data (RDF / exports produced by this project)**:  
  The derived metadata and RDF knowledge graph exports generated by this project are released under **ODbL 1.0**.

- **Code**:  
  The source code is released under the **MIT License**.

- **Software stack**:  
  Built with **Streamlit** and **Python** (plus supporting libraries included in the repository).
