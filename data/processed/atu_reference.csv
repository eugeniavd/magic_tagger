1000;Contest Not to Become Angry;"A farmhand (poor boy/strong man; often the third son) agrees to a contest with his master (devil, ogre, priest) that whoever becomes angry first (often before the cuckoo calls) must accept a punishment (e.g., strips of skin/flesh cut from the back; nose or ears cut off; beating) or pay a large sum. The farmhand provokes the master by abuse or feigned stupidity until the master erupts in anger and loses; the master tries to flee but is ultimately punished."
1060;Squeezing the (Supposed) Stone.;"An ogre (giant, devil) and a (poor) man (tailor, Gypsy) have a contest to see which of them can squeeze water out of a stone. The ogre squeezes a stone; the man a cheese (egg, turnip) and thus intimidates the ogre. (In some variants, the actors are animals.)"
1060*;Squeezing the Hand;An ogre (giant) and a man (tailor, sailor) compete to determine whose handshake is stronger. The man wears an iron glove and wins. In some variants, the man holds out a (glowing) iron rod (fork, etc.).
1168;Various Ways of Exorcising Devils;Miscellaneous type. The devil is frightened by a shoe- maker and gives him gold [K335]. (Previously Type 1166*.) He is threatened (beaten) by a soldier, who uses a crucifix or exorcised by a foolhardy man who draws a magic circle, etc
1174;Making a Rope of Sand;A man saves his soul from the devil because the latter is not able to make a rope of sand (chaff). In some variants, a ruler demands a rope of sand (ashes) from one of his subjects (man, woman), who – sometimes helped by good advice – is able to perform the task.
1651A;Fortune in Salt;A man (merchant, youth) finds a country in which salt is unknown. He sells a cargo of salt for a high price and becomes rich
300;The Dragon-Slayer;"A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three wonderful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the cur - rent year, the king’s daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dr agon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978. 2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragon’s heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragon’s heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wed ding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the king’s table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon- slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragon’s tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. C"
300A;The Fight on the Bridge;After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511. 5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601]. While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six- [B11.2.3.3], twelve- [B11.2. 3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like,) the animal son overhears the con versations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], de - feats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragon’s mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10. 3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragon’s mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragon’s mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men. (Previously Type 300A*.) Cf. Type 328A*. (2) The animal son defeats the strongest dragon and wins his horse for the tsar.
301;The Three Stolen Princesses;"This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.) steals golden apples from the king’s garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youn gest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the en- trance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses’ help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treach- erous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again"
301A;The Three Stolen Princesses (var.);See Type 301
301D*;The Princess’s Ring;When she goes for a walk, a princess (daughter of a tsar) disappears. Her father promises her to whoever finds and rescues her [T68.1]. A sol - dier takes a ship and goes out to search for the princess. On a lonely island he meets a dragon (giant, devil), makes him drunk with wine, cuts off his head and takes away his keys [B11.11]. He finds the prin - cess and takes her to the ship. Just when they are about to sail, the princess asks for a ring she forgot, and the soldier goes back to get it. Meanwhile the ship sails away and the treacherous captain forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933]. The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier
302C*;The Magic Horse;"At the wish of the dead king, his youngest son permits his three sisters to marry the first suitors who come for them. Visiting his brothers-in-law, he learns that they are the masters of the three kingdoms of animals. The prince wins a wife who forbids him to enter a certain room [C611]. He disregards her prohibition and revives a dragon (demon) who is impaled on a wall (contained in a hoop). The dragon frees himself and abducts the prince’s wife. The prince searches for her and three times tries to flee with her. Riding on his magic horse, the dragon overtakes the two but does not kill the prince, because he promised to spare his life three times; the fourth time, he cuts him up. Signals of distress tell the brothers-in-law that the prince is in danger, and they come and resuscitate him. He goes back to the dragon, asks his wife to find out where the magic horse came from, and learns that a certain witch owns one. On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witch’s three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince chooses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragon’s horse, and it compels the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife."
303;The Twins Or Blood-Brothers;"After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grate- ful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three prin- cesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (“Red Knight”) who pretended to be the princess’s rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea mon- ster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them."
307;The Princess in the Coffin;After a hasty wish (curse), a diabolic (black, mute) daughter is born to a childless couple (king and queen) [C758.1, S223]. The daughter demands that when she dies, there should be a night-watch at her coffin in the church (graveyard) (someone should watch over her for three nights in or - der to save her). The dead girl rises every night from the coffin and swallows the man on guard [E251]. A soldier (boy) learns from an old man what he must do to free the girl from the witchcraft [N825.2]. During the first two nights, he hides from the dead girl. During the third night, when the girl leaves the coffin, the soldier lies down in it, refuses to let her in, and forces her (by means of a rusty sword) to say a Paternoster (sing a hymn at the altar). As she says the prayer, the rooster crows and the girl is disenchanted [D791.1.7]. The guards are revived and the girl marries her rescuer [L162]. (The soldier tears his bride into two parts and shakes out the bad spirit in the form of reptiles.) Various other magic or religious means can be used to save the princess
312;Maiden-Killer (Bluebeard);An odd-looking rich man (e.g. with a blue beard [S62.1]) takes his bride to his splendid castle. She is forbidden to open a certain room, but she disobeys and finds it full of the dead bodies of her prede - cessors [C611]. The husband wants to kill her for her dis obedience [C920], but she is able to delay the punishment (three times) [K551]. She (her sister) calls their brother (three brothers) who kills the husband (sometimes with help from a dog or other animal) and rescues his sister(s)
312D;Rescue by the Brother;A dragon (devil) carries off a girl (three girls) and kills her brothers when they try to rescue her. After a magic conception (often by swallowing a pea [T511.3]), the mother of the siblings gives birth to a strong son [F611.1]. This son kills the dragon, rescues his sister, and resuscitates his brothers. The envious brothers plan to kill the youngest. But because of his strength he is able to free himself and to punish his brothers.
313;The Magic Flight;This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the “Magic Flight” and the “Forgotten Fian- cée”. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the man’s unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222, S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threat - ening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demon’s daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her father’s house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the prince’s blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Never - theless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fiancé into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.) which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad step- mother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fiancée [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the bride’s warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus for - gets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fiancée reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husband’s new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006. 1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride.
313A;The Magic Flight (var.);See Type 313
314;Goldener;"This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 314A, 502, and 530. Introductory episodes: (1) A boy has been promised (often in return for magic con ception) to a demon (devil, giant) [S211], or he voluntarily becomes a servant in a demon’s house [G462]. The demon orders him to care for two (groups of) animals, to feed the one and to neglect the other. The boy does not follow these instructions and thus makes friends with the abused animal (magic horse) [B316]. Against the prohibi tion of the demon, he enters a certain chamber [C611]. As a mark of disobedi - ence, his hair turns gold [C912]. The boy and the magic horse escape from the demon by a magic flight [D672]. (2) A boy (usually the son of a ruler) and a magic foal are close friends . The mother (stepmother) wants to kill the boy. The magic foal warns the boy of her secret murderous attempts. At last the mother demands that the boy or the foal be killed. The boy pre - tends to agree but asks his father to be allowed to ride the foal one last time. During this ride the foal flies away together with the boy [B184.1.6]. (3) In return for his magic conception, a boy is promised to a demon [G461]. On the way to the demon’s house, the boy is fore - warned (given instructions for how to kill the demon or to flee). In the rooms of the demon’s house, the boy finds prisoners or corpses (and his hair turns to gold [C912]). The boy kills the demon and flees. Main part: The youth covers his golden hair, pretending to be a scaldhead, and takes service in the king’s court as a gardener [K1816.1]. (He says nothing except, “I don’t know”. [C495.1]; previously Type 532.) But the youngest princess sees him in his true form (as a golden-haired knight who destroys and restores the garden three times) [H75.4]. She falls in love with Goldener [T91.6.4] and chooses him as her husband by throwing a golden apple to him [T55.1]. They marry but the angry king banishes the couple to a shabby lodging [L132, L113.1.0.1]. The king demands the help of his sons-in-law. Goldener has only a poor kit and is mocked. With the help of his magic horse he achieves various heroic deeds: He obtains the magic remedy (e.g. milk of a bird, water of life) for the king who had grown blind (cf. Type 551), kills a dragon (cf. Type 300), defeats a foreign army three times in disguise. He is wounded and is bandaged by the king. Three times he withdraws and is mocked as a fool. Cf. Type 530. Goldener’s identity is revealed (e.g. by wounds, brands) and his true status is recognized [H55, H56]. The horse asks to be de capi tated and becomes a prince (princess, other person)"
325;The Magician and His Pupil;A father apprentices his son to a magi - cian [D1711.0.1]. In order for the son to be released at the end of the apprenticeship, the father has to recognize him [H62.1, H161]. The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magi cian’s in - fluence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tor mented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.) and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, trans- formed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princess’s lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground. The magician as a rooster is about to eat the corn, but the youth becomes a fox and bites off the rooster’s head [L142.2]. He marries the princess
326;The Youth Who Wanted to Learn What Fear is;A youth (fool) who does not know what fear is goes to find it [H1376.2]. He tries vari - ous frightening experiences without becoming afraid [H1400]: He is shaved by a barber-ghost [E571], spends the night under a gallows [H1415] or in a haunted castle [E281], plays with dead persons (bowl- ing [E577.3], cards [E577.2]), etc. Through his fearless behavior he disenchants a castle (wins a treasure, a promised princess) [Q82]. The youth finally learns what fear is when cold water is thrown on him [H1441], fishes are put into his bed while he is asleep [H1441.1], birds fly into his face, his cut-off head is put on backwards, etc. Sometimes sexual: he finds a woman in his bed
326B*;The Youth and the Corpse;A fearless youth carries a corpse (several corpses), frightens some robbers by pretending to eat it [K335.1.10], and takes away their booty. Using the corpse, he overpowers evil spirits, frees a princess, and marries her
327A;Hansel and Gretel;A (poor) father (persuaded by the stepmother) abandons his children (a boy and a girl) in the forest [S321, S143]. Twice the children find their way back home, following scattered pebbles [R135]. On the third night, birds eat the scattered peas (bread- crumbs) [R135.1]. The children come upon a gingerbread house which belongs to a witch (ogress) [G401, F771.1.10, G412.1]. She takes them into her house. The boy is fattened [G82], while the girl must do housework. The witch asks the boy to show his finger in order to test how fat he is [G82.1], but he shows her a bone (stick) [G82.1.1]. When the witch wants to cook the boy, the sister deceives her by feigning ignorance and pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. (The witch’s son finds out that his mother has been killed and pursues the children.) The children escape, carrying the witch’s treasure with them. Birds and beasts (angels) help them across water. They return home
328;The Boy Steals the Ogre’s Treasure;Introduction (sometimes missing): Three (twelve, thirteen, thirty, etc.) brothers arrive at the house of an ogre (devil). He would kill them in the night, but the smart young est brother saves them by exchanging their caps with those of the ogre’s daughters. (Cf. Types 327B, 1119.) The brothers take service at the king’s court. Main part: The jealous brothers claim that the youngest can steal the ogre’s treasures [H1151, H911]: magic horse [H1151.9], bedspread, carpet, parrot (lamp, sword [D1400.1.4.1], silver or golden poultry, musical instruments [D1233], etc.). Using tricks the youth gets these objects. Cf. Types 1525, 1525A. At last the brothers claim that the youngest can kidnap the ogre himself [H1172]. In disguise the youth tells the ogre that the thief died and persuades him to lie down in the coffin to measure it [G514.1]. The youth nails up the coffin, traps the ogre, and is given a princess as his wife. In some variants, the youth sets out to steal from the ogre in order to get revenge for former ill-treatment [G610.1] or to help a friendly king [G610.3]. In some variants, mainly from northern and north-western Europe and the Americas, the protagonist is female
328C*;"[et] Uba pidi taevasse";"Source: Estonian tale types: https://www.folklore.ee/muinasjutt/tyybid/#_IMEMUINASJUTUD"
329;Hiding from the Princess;A princess promises to marry whoever can hide himself so well that she cannot find him [H321]. Those who fail are beheaded (heads are displayed on stakes) [H901.1]. A (poor) youth (youngest of three brothers) undertakes the task. Because he had helped some animals (an old man), a fish hides him in his belly, an eagle behind the clouds (the sun), and a fox under the earth [D684, H982]. The princess finds him with her magic mirror (magic book) or her perfect sight. The princess gives the youth a fourth trial: He hides behind the magic mirror (under the princess’s seat) or transforms himself (is transformed) and sits as a louse (sticks as a rose) in her hair, etc. [D641]. The princess cannot find him, so she grants his superiority and marries him
330B;The Smith and the Devil (var);A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall al - ways win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free
331;The Spirit in the Bottle;A man (son of a woodcutter, smith, fisherman, soldier) frees an evil spirit from a vessel (bottle) out of curios- ity (because he was asked by the spirit) [R181]. The spirit (which stretches out to an enormous height,) wants to take revenge for being locked for so long, and threatens to kill his rescuer. The man tricks the spirit: He pretends he does not believe that the spirit could grow small again and thus induces him to go back into the vessel [K717]. The man stoppers the bottle and the spirit is trapped. In some variants, he is released again in return for a gift (wonderful remedy, magic power
361;Bear-Skin;A poor soldier sells his soul to the devil for an immense amount of money (a purse which will never be empty) [M211]. The soldier’s soul will be released after he has lived for seven years wit - hout washing or combing himself [C721.1, C723.1]. The soldier helps a poor man, who agrees to let him marry one of his daughters. The two elder daughters scoff at the dirty man, but the youngest daughter agrees to marry him [L54.1]. The soldier leaves her a token (half of a ring or coin). After seven years the bargain is completed. The devil washes and dresses the soldier, and releases him. He returns to his bride as a rich gentleman and is recognized by the token. The envious elder sisters commit suicide. Thus instead of one soul the devil gets two (sometimes more)
363;The Corpse-Eater;A young woman wants to marry a man with an unusual feature (green beard, golden nose, etc.). A demonic bridegroom with these characteristics appears, and she follows him to his far-away castle. On the way she watches him eating corpses in three churches (graveyards) [G20]. Cf. Type 894. The bridegroom asks her whether she has seen anything. She says no, even when he appears in the form of her father and brother [D40, D610]. Finally, in the form of her mother, he asks her and she confesses. She is devoured (is able to flee at the last moment)
365;The Dead Bridegroom Carries off His Bride;A young woman mourns for her bridegroom who did not return from war (brings him back to life by magic). One night he appears, invites her to ride with him, and carries her behind on his horse. Two times he asks her whether she is afraid. She says no because her lover is with her. The third time they arrive at a graveyard. When the bridegroom wants to entice her into an open grave, she realizes that he is dead. He grasps at her and tears her clothing. The bride escapes (is pulled into the grave [E215], danced to death by the dancing dead, or torn to pieces
402;The Animal Bride;"A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inher - it his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money ) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]). 235 Tales of Magic FFC 284 The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapi - tation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog’s skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her."
407;The Girl as Flower;This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her pre destined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (some times her ve - getable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiancée) signals the girl to come. She ap pears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Pre viously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip) [E631.1] which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman. Her husband takes her as his wife (often on the condition that he may not talk about her or present her in public, so that the devil will not be able to find her). The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell).
410;Sleeping Beauty;"A daughter is born to a royal couple. A fairy (wise woman) who has not been invited to the celebration (baptism) utters a curse that the princess (on her 15th birthday) will die of a wound from a spindle (needle, fiber of flax) [F361.1.1, F316, G269.4, M341.2.13]. Another fairy changes the death sentence into a long (hundred-year) sleep [F316.1]. The king orders that every spindle (needle) in his empire be destroyed; but, because one of them has been overlooked, the prophecy is fulfilled [M370]: The girl meets an old woman who is spinning in a hidden chamber, pricks her finger with the spindle, and sinks, together with the whole court, into a magic sleep [D1364. 17, D1960.3, F771.4.4, F771.4.7]. Around the castle grows a hedge of thorns [D1967.1] (the girl is enclosed in a tower). At the end of the appointed time, a youth (prince) breaks through the hedge [N711.2] and awakens the princess with a kiss [D735, D1978.5] (he impregnates her; she gives birth to two children, one of whom sucks the fiber out of her finger and thus disenchants her). In some variants the prince takes his wife and children to his family. During his absence the evil mother-in-law asks the cook to slaughter and roast the woman and the children. The cook disobeys, and the mother-in-law demands that the three be thrown into a tub full of poisonous toads and snakes. Unexpectedly the prince returns home, and the mother-in-law herself jumps into the tub"

425A;The Animal as Bridegroom;This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 430, 432, and 441. Introductory episodes: (1) The youngest daughter asks her father (the king) to bring her a (musical) rose (lark, etc.) from his journey. He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C. (2) An animal-son (snake, crayfish, also pumpkin, etc.) is born (because of the hasty wish of his parents) [C758.1]. He demands a princess for his wife and performs difficult (impossible) tasks. The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives to - gether with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1]. Main part: When the young wife (often on the advice of her female rela - tives) burns the animal-skin of her bridegroom [C757.1] (looks at him during the night or burns him with candle wax [C32.1, C916.1], reveals his secret [C421], or otherwise prevents his disenchantment), he goes away [C932]. The young wife sets out for a long and difficult quest [H1385.4] (in iron shoes [Q502.2], etc.). On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235). She arrives (sometimes by climb ing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegroom’s far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.) for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a sopor ific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride
425C;Beauty and the Beast;A mer - chant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back pres ents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes , the youngest a rose [L221]. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute [S222]. The youngest daughter meets her father’s obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time [C761.2]. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she dis - enchants the prince from his animal shape [D735.1]. They marry
425M;The Snake as Bridegroom;A serpent (water being, dragon) steals the clothes of a bathing girl and gives them back only when she promises to marry him [K1335]. The serpent takes her as his bride to his splendid castle (at the bottom of the sea) where she gives birth to two children. The serpent promises that the woman may visit her parents if she performs certain impossible tasks (wearing out iron shoes [H1125, Q502.2], spinning an endless thread, etc.) [H1010]. By fol low ing the advice of an old woman she succeeds [N825.3], and finally she and her children are allowed to visit her parents for three days. But she is warned not to tell anyone about her husband [C421]. The woman keeps the promise. The children, however, tell the relatives about their father and give away the secret of the magic formula by which he can be summoned. The woman’s brothers call the serpent and kill him. Together with her children the woman returns. She calls her husband, but there is only blood in the sea. So she realises that the children have betrayed her and condemns them to be turned into Trees.
449;Sidi Numan;This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man discovers that his wife eats corpses in the night. When he accuses her of this, she turns him into a dog. Another sorceress recognizes that the dog is really a human and returns him to his original form. With her help the husband is able to turn his wife into a mare and he beats her (to death). (2) An unfaithful wife turns her husband into a dog [D141, K1535], which herds sheep and also rescues the king’s baby [D682. 3]. When he returns to his wife, she turns him into a bird [D151.8]. He finds a magic wand, becomes a man again, and changes his wife and her lover into donkeys
450;Little Brother and Little Sister;Little brother and little sister run away from their home because of their cruel stepmother [S31.5, S31] or because their parents want to eat them. In spite his sister’s warn- ing, the brother drinks from a spring or an animal’s track [D555] and is transformed into a deer [D114.1.1] (lamb [D135], goat). The children live together in the forest until a prince finds them [P253.2, N711.1]. The sister hides up in a tree but the prince tricks her into com ing down. She marries the prince and they take the animal brother with them. The prince is absent when their child is born. The sister is re - placed by another bride [K1911, K1911.1.2], often the daughter of a bad woman (stepmother, witch, maid). The sister is thrown into the water [S142], transformed into a bird [D150] (fish [D170]), or swal- low ed by a fish [K1911.2.2.1]. She returns at night to suckle her child [E323.1.1, D688] and to look after her brother. A servant over hears the conversation between the animal brother and the sister and informs the prince [H13]. The false bride and her mother are punished. Cf. Type 403. In some variants the false bride and her mother want to kill the animal brother because they fear that the truth will be discovered. The cook saves him.
461;Three Hairs from the Devil’s Beard;A poor young man wants to marry the daughter of a king (rich man). Her father tries to get rid of the young man by sending him to the devil (ogre) to bring him three hairs of the devil’s beard [H1273.2]. On his way some objects and animals ask the young man to ask the devil some questions 272 Hans-Jörg Uther FFC 284 [H1291]. A well wants to know why it has dried up, a tree wants to know why it is withered and the ferryman who rows the hero to the devil wants to know when he will be replaced. With the help of the devil’s mother (grandmother, wife) [G530.1], who asks her son when she louses him or when he is asleep, the young man gets the three hairs and the answers to his questions [H1292]. The ferryman has to give the oar to someone else [Q521.5], the spring of the well is blocked by a frog [A1111], and the roots of the tree are damaged by a treasure (snake). For his answers and help the young man receives a large reward, and the king has to accept him as son-in-law. The greedy king also wants to get treasures on the way to the devil, but he becomes the replacement for the ferryman.
465B;Красавица-жена (Гусли-самогуды) (rus.);"Царь (князь, барин) хочет овладеть чужой женой и посылает мужа добыть гусли-самогуды; муж выполняет эту задачу."
470;Friends in Life and Death;Two friends promise each other to be guests at each other’s weddings. One of them dies but takes part invisibly in the wedding of the living friend. He invites him for a return visit [E238]. The living friend also takes part in the wedding of his friend in the otherworld. They take a long journey through the otherworld and see strange things: a broad and a narrow road to heaven and hell [F171.2], fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one (formerly rich and poor people) [F171.1], people and animals who argue [F171.3], etc. When the living man returns he finds that he has been away many (three) centuries [D2011]. All is changed and he knows no one. He dies or turns to dust
476*;In the Frog’s House;A woman promises a frog to be friends and be - comes midwife (godmother) to the frog’s wife. She takes the frog’s child to be christened, sweeps the dust in the frog’s house, and takes the garbage home with her. There it becomes gold (money). In some variants she frees drowned souls or brings up the child of the frog for seven years and then is able to release its parents from enchantment.
480;The Kind and the Unkind Girls;A girl is mistreated by her stepmother [S31] and has to work very hard [H934.3]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle [N777.4]) [N777.2, N791]. She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head [H935, Q41.2, G466]. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she chooses the plain one [L211]. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped [N777]), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc. [H1226]). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken [D1658.1.5]. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks [G204, H935]: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon [G466], has to comb the hair of fairies [H1192], has to carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] or wash black wool white [H1023.6]. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded [Q41] with gold, jewels, etc., becomes more beautiful [D1860], or jewels fall from her mouth [D1454.2]. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room [C611]. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals [B350], objects [D1658], and people of her out - ward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situ - ations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth [M431.2], horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince
480A;Girl and Devil in a Strange House;A girl leaves home because of her cruel stepmother. On her way she helps some animals and takes them with her. During the night they stay in a strange house. A demon (devil) tries to enter (to dance with the girl, to marry her), but the girl refuses to open the door unless he gives her certain valurable gifts. When morning comes, the demon has not fulfilled all the wishes so he cannot enter the house. He loses his strength and goes away. This is often followed by account of the unfriendly stepsister who gives no help to the animals and is killed by the demon
480D*;Tales of Kind and Unkind Girls;This miscellaneous type consists of various tales in which an unkind girl (neighbor, wife) wants to have the same re ward that a kind one received. However, she is too selfish and is pun ish ed instead

502;The Wild Man;A king catches a wild man (Iron John) and puts him into a cage, forbidding anyone to set him free. His son frees the pris- oner because his ball rolls into the cage or because he feels pity for him. The prince is afraid of his father’s anger and leaves home (his father drives him away to be killed or sends him to another king) along with a servant. On their way the servant persuades the prince to exchange clothes. The prince becomes a servant at the court of another king. At a tournament he appears unrecognized three times on a splendid horse [R222] which he received from the wild man and wins the hand of a princess. Or, he wins the princess because he has helped her father in war [L161]. Often the wild man is disenchanted [G671]. In some variants the prince works for a while at the wild man’s house where he disobeys instructions (e.g. looks into a forbidden chamber [C611], cares for a horse although it is not allowed [B316]) and his hair turns to gold.
511;One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes;A girl (boy) has a stepmother who does not give her enough to eat but makes her herd cattle and spin a great amount of flax. She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, god - mother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (in- testines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the step- sisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree go es (is taken) with them. The stepmother and step- sisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsis - ter discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these over - comes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girl’s father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals . A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother.
513A;Six Go through the Whole World;A discharged soldier (fool) acquires many (six) traveling companions with extraordinary abilities [F601]: e.g. one who runs fast [F681.1], one who eats great quan - tities [F632, F633], one who produces (can withstand) severe frost [D2144.1.2], one who can shoot and hit the left eye of a fly from far away [F661.5.3], one with acute hearing [F641.1, F641.2, F641.3], one who can make himself taller, and one who can rip up trees by their roots [F621]. In order to avenge himself on the king who dis charged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess [H331]. She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running [H331.5.1]. The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity [H1114, H1142], which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven [H1511], which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess [F605.2]. In the end he marries her.
530;The Princess on the Glass Mountain;A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The king’s daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2]. In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess sum mons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the king’s household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses).
530A;The Pig with the Golden Bristles;A king commands his (three) sons- in-law to get magic animals: a pig with golden bristles, a golden- horned stag, wild boars from the sea, etc. The stupidest of the sons (another foolish boy) gets these wonders, but trades them to his brothers in return for their cut-off fingers and pieces of skin from their backs. At the feast where the brothers are honored, they are exposed as cheaters by the pieces of evidence shown by the fool.
531;The Clever Horse;This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, “The Godchild of the King and the Unfaithful Companion”, “The Golden-haired Maiden”, and “The Clever Horse”. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horse’s advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beard less man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the king’s court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boy’s companion) slan - ders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boil- ing milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, re juvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king.
550;Bird, Horse and Princess;The type combines two different introductory episodes with a com mon main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the king’s tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a gold- en bird [B102.1] and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331. 1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there never theless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird [L13, B313, B560, H1233.6]. Against the fox’s advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184. 1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (prin - cess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the fox’s help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the fox’s advice he releases his brothers from the gal lows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who res cued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the bird’s singing.
551;Water of Life;A sick king can only be healed by a wonderful remedy [H1324, D1500.1.18] (water of life [H1321.2], rejuvenating apples, phoenix bird [H1331.1], etc.). Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She ar - rives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accom pany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The young est brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened.
552;The Girls Who Married Animals;"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers’ advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three ani- mal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry anyone even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls’ father visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically pro - vided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragic- ally)"
554;The Grateful Animals;) This miscellaneous type comprises vari- ous tales dealing with helpful deeds of grateful animals. In numer ous tales the type occurs only as episode. Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he pre vents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and careless - ness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc.
556A*;The Grateful Animals (var.);See Type 554
556F*;The Shepherd in the Service of a Witch;A father sends one of his three sons to tend the cattle (sheep, etc.) of a landlord who is a soothsayer (prince of sun, witch). When the boy drives the cattle to pasture, they suddenly disappear (in the forest, crossing a brook). He can - not follow them because he is confined in a tree (by a super natural woman ). After a while the cattle return, but he does not know where they have been or what they have eaten. Consequently he has not accomplished his task (and is punished). Then his brother tries, but he also loses the cattle. When the youngest brother tends the cattle, he succeeds with the help of the animals (the woman who had caught his brothers in the tree). By following the cattle, he learns that they transform themselves to women (daughters of the witch) during their absence. So he has accomplished his task
567;The Magic Bird-Heart;A man eats the heart of a magic bird and thereby receives the power of spitting gold [B113.1] (of finding a coin under his pillow every day, he becomes king [D1561.1.1, M312. 3]). A woman (his own wife) causes him to vomit the bird-heart, eats it herself (because she learned its secret from an old woman) [D861.5] and casts him out. He finds a magic herb that transforms people into donkies [D965, D983, D551.2, D132.1, D661]. With the help of the herb he changes the woman to donkey (and makes it work hard). Cf. Type 566. In some variants he changes the woman back to a human being and marries her
580;Beloved of Women;At their father’s death three brothers are each granted a wish: the two elder ones wish for riches, but the youngest wishes for the power to make women love him [D1900]. They set out on a journey and spend the night in three different inns. The youngest brother sleeps with the wife (daughter) of the house and receives three magic objects [D856]: a tablecloth on which food magically appears, a rooster (similar) that produces drinks, and a pair of scissors that produces clothes out of nothing. The brothers reach a town where all who enter must be castrated. The youngest refuses and is taken as a prisoner to an island. With the help of his magic objects he secures a comfortable life for himself and the other prisoners. A princess (king’s widow) wants to buy the objects. The boy is only willing to give them to her if he may spend the night in her chamber, beside her, and finally in her bed [T45]. At the end he marries her
592;The Dance among Thorns;A poor boy, driven from home by his evil stepmother [S322.4] (dismissed from service with a pittance [W154. 1]), gives all his money as alms to a beggar (supernatural being) [Q42.1] who in return grants the boy three wishes [D1761.0.2]: a never failing gun [D1653.1.7] (crossbow [D1653.1.4]), a fiddle (flute) that compels people to dance [D1415.2.5], another magic object or the magic power of having his wishes obeyed [D1761.0.1]. He shoots a bird (on a wager [N55, N55.1]), which falls into a thornbush. When a monk (Jew, the loser of the wager) tries to take the bird out, the boy’s magic fiddle makes him dance in the thorns. The boy is condemned and led to the gallows. He asks for per - mis sion to play his fiddle for the last time. The judge and whole assembly have to dance until the boy is released
613;The Two Travelers;) Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) [N61] about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They call on animals and people they meet to act as judges [K451.1, N92]. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out [M225, N2.3.3, S165]. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree [F1045], where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches) [B253, G661.1, N451.1, N452]. By means of this knowledge [H963] he is able to restore his sight [D1505.5], to cure sickness (of the prin - cess, king) [C940.1, D2064.1, V34.2], to end drought [F933.2, H1193, N452.1], etc. [N552.1.1, D2101, H1181]. He is rewarded (marries the princess [H346]). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces
650A;Strong John;A young man, born of an animal (son of a bear) or from a giant (troll-woman, forged from iron by a smith) [B631, F611.1.1, F611.1.11–F611.1.15, T516] develops great strength (at the forge, in the forest, in war, by suckling for many years [F611.2.1, F611.2.3], by his great appetite, by tests of strength [F611.3.1], etc.). Because of his enormous appetite he is sent away from home [F612.1, F614.1]. He works for a smith but (often) injures his master [K1411, K1421, K1422], who tries to get rid of him by setting trials of strength [H931, F514.2, F612.3.1, F614.6]. The strong man has to up- root trees, to catch wolves and bears (lions, etc.), to tame devils, etc. [F613–F613.4]. When he is sent to catch wild animals [F615.2.3], he harnesses them to a coach. When he is in a well and a mill stone (bell) is thrown on him, he wears it as collar or complains that chickens are scratching dirt onto him [F615.3.1, F615.3.1.1]. When he is sent to the devil’s mill (hell), he drives the devil to his master’s house [F80, F615.1, H1272]. When he goes to the king to be paid, the king shoots him (in vain) with cannons. The strong man accom plishes every task and overcomes all difficulties [F615] (kills his master and finally marries)

671;The Three Languages;A young man learns the languages of dogs [B215.2], birds [B215.1], and frogs [B215.4]. His father, angry at such useless knowledge, drives him out and orders him to be killed. A compassionate servant lets him escape and substitutes an animal’s heart as proof for the murder [K512.2]. By means of his knowledge of the dogs’ language the boy dis- covers a treasure (he cures a sick princess and marries her later). Through his knowledge of the frogs’ language he learns that he will be elected pope [H171.2]. When he arrives in Rome, two doves come to sit on his shoulders and he is recognized as a man worthy of being pope (birds indicate his election as pope [H171.2]). The two doves tell him what to do so that he will be elected pope, and give him advice on how to act.
671E*;A Magic Boy;A boy understands the language of birds and can in - terpret dreams. A merchant takes the boy in payment for goods and orders him to be slaughtered. He wants to eat the boy’s heart and liver in order to obtain his wisdom. The boy escapes. The mer chant is called to the king to interpret a dream. He cannot do this. The boy arrives, interprets the dream, and exposes the merchant.
677;Iron is More Precious than Gold;An unlucky man asks his king for advice about what he should do. The princess advises him to marry because the luck of his wife (children) could counteract his own bad luck. The king allows him to marry the princess. When she sends him out to sell her needlework, he trades it for (threefold) pieces of good advice. He does not dare to return home without any money and finds work on a ship. When the ship is becalmed, he is sent down to the bottom of the sea to repair it, and there he settles a quarrel between two spirits: What is more precious (more useful, harder): gold (diamond, silver, copper) or iron (steel, copper)? He gives a (diplomatic) answer (following the first good advice). He receives a bag of (precious) stones as a reward and re- turns to the ship. Together with the merchants he reaches a strange country where the king favors him because of his jewels. The merchants are jealous and make a bet as to who is the richest of them. Following the sec ond advice, he wins the wager and with it all the servants and the ship. He continues to travel and trades for 7–30 years. Finally he returns home and finds his wife sleeping between two strange men. When he is about to kill all three, he remembers the third piece of advice, to think before he acts. He finds that the men are his two grown-up sons.

700;Thumbling;"A childless couple wish for a child, however small he may be. They have a boy (by supernatural birth) the size of a thumb [F535.1]. Thumbling takes food to his father on the farm and drives the wagon (plow) by sitting in the horse’s (ox’s) ear [F535.1.1.1]. He allows himself to be sold to strangers and then runs away from them. He lets himself be sold to thieves and accompanies them while they steal. Thumbling either helps them or he betrays them by his shouting; he then robs the thieves. Cf. Type 1525E. He is swallowed by a cow [F911.3.1], talks from the cow’s insides and reappears [F913] (in the sausage prepared from the intestines of the slaughtered cow [F535.1.1.8]). Someone takes the intestines (sausage) and, frightened by Thumbling’s voice inside, throws them away. Thumbling is swallowed by a wolf (fox) who eats the in tes- tines [F911.3.1]. He talks from the wolf’s belly and the wolf becomes sick and frightens (warns) shepherds. The wolf dies (is killed) and Thumbling is rescued [F913], or he persuades the wolf to take him to his father’s house"

703*;The Artificial Child;An aged, childless couple build (carve) them - selves a child from snow. When the child goes into the forest (jumps over a fire), it melts. Or a beautiful girl made from snow organizes a competition. She promises to marry any man who can overtake her on horseback, while she runs. By her magic actions (obstacles), she manages to leave all her suitors behind by magic actions (obstacles). The son of the emperor recognizes the magic, conjures the girl in the name of God to stop, and takes her up on his horseback. When they reach the top of a hill, the girl has disappearsed. In some variants the girl is made from gold and stays dumb until she is addressed by her name.
706;The Maiden without Hands;A girl has her hands cut off [Q451.1, S11.1] because she refuses to mar - ry her father [S322.1.2] (because her father has sold her to the devil [S211], forbids her to pray, her sister-in-law has slandered her to her brother). She is exposed in the forest and eats fruit from a garden. A king finds her in the forest (garden, stable, sea) and marries her [N711] in spite of her mutilation [L162]. She gives birth but is cast out along with her children, because her parents-in-law (father, mother, sister-in-law, devil) alter a letter from the king [K2117, K2110.1]. During her second banishment her hands grow back again [E782.1], usually restored by water (river, well, sea water), often with supernatural help (angel, saint, Virgin Mary, God). She is reunited with her husband [
707;The Three Golden Children;"Three girls boast that if they marry the king [N201] they will have triplets with golden hair [H71.2, H71.3], a chain around the neck [H71.7], and a star on the forehead [H71.1]. The king overhears the youngest and marries her [L162, N455.4]. When she gives birth to three marvelous children the elder sis- ters substitute animals (dogs) [K2115]. She is imprisoned (banished) [K2110.1, S410], her children are exposed [S142, S301] but are res cued by a miller [R131.2] (fisherman [R131.4]). When they have grown up, the eldest son sets out to find his father [H1381.2.2.1], to seek a speaking bird [H1331.1.1], a singing tree [H1333.1.1], or the water of life [H1320, H1321.1, H1321.4, H1321.5]. He and his brother both fail and are transformed to marble columns [D231.2]. The sister, with the help of an old woman [N825. 3], succeeds in rescuing them [R158] and in bringing back the magic objects. The attention of the king is drawn to the children and the magic objects [H151.1]. The bird of truth reveals the whole story [B131.2, K1911.3.1]. The children and their mother are restored; the sisters are punished"

709;Snow White;Snow White has a skin white as snow and lips red as blood [Z65.1]. A magic mirror tells her stepmother that Snow White is more beautiful than she [D1323.1, D1311.2, L55, M312.4]. The jealous stepmother orders a hunter to kill Snow White [S322.2], but he substitutes an animal’s heart and saves her [K512.2]. Snow White goes to a house of dwarfs (robbers) [N831.1] who adopt Snow White as their sister [F451.5.1.2]. The stepmother now attempts to kill her by means of poisoned lace [D1364.16, S111.2], a poisoned comb [D1364.9, S111.3] and a poisoned apple [D1364.4.1, S111.4]. The dwarfs succeed in reviving the maiden from the first two poisonings but fail with the third. They lay her in a glass coffin [F852.1]. A prince resuscitates her and marries her [E21.1, E21.3]. The step- mother is made to dance herself to death in red hot shoes.
735A;Bad Luck Imprisoned;A poor brother leaves home to find better luck in another place, but his personified bad luck (poverty) [N112] wants to go with him. On a pretext the man locks up the bad luck in a bottle (bag, chest) [N112.1] or buries (drowns) it (and from then on lives happily [previously Type 332F*]). When his rich brother frees the bad luck out of jealousy, it at taches itself to him because it is afraid of the clever poor brother.

737;Who Will be Her Future Husband?;On New Year’s Eve (Christmas Eve) a young woman foresees her future husband [D1825.1], a sol- dier. When the apparition leaves, she manages to keep his sabre (sword). When the soldier comes home, they marry. Later he finds his sword in a chest. He (nearly) kills his wife (and himself) with the sword because he had suffered so much from the loss of his weapon
740**;The Brother (the Poor Man) about to Hang Himself Finds a Treasure;A rich greedy man, asked for help by his poor brother, gives him instead of money a rope and advises him to hang himself. The poor brother chooses a tree under which the rich man has bur - ied money. When he tries to hang himself, the tree snaps at ground level and he discovers the treasure [N528]. The rich brother, having lost his treasure, hangs himself.
809*;Rich Man Allowed to Stay in Heaven;Rich Man Allowed to Stay in Heaven because of single deed of charity. (Sometimes he is repaid and sent to hell.)
849*;The Cross as Security;A merchant borrows money, leaving a cross (icon) as security. During a storm, fearing a shipwreck, he throws a barrel with the money into the water. The barrel floats back to the creditor. In another version a poor man borrows flour from a rich man, leaving an icon of St. Nicholas as security. The rich man threatens to destroy the icon if it is not redeemed in time. A young man over - hears the deal, procures money, redeems the icon, and places it in his mother’s house. In order to earn money he decides to sell goods at a fair. On his way he gives a lift to an old man who later helps him to endure dangers during a wake. Finally the old man revives the dead daughter of the czar and the young man marries her. The old man makes the young wife into a happy, healthy person before he leaves. The young couple returns to the boy’s mother where they learn that the icon is back in its usual place, but that it had disappeared for a while
935;The Prodigal’s Return;A lazy (stupid) son leaves home and dis sipates his fortune abroad. He becomes a soldier and asks his father for money by sending him a (three) letter pretending to have be come a lieutenant (captain). The deception is discovered and the fath er expels his son. Through a trick (cleverness, magic) the young man makes his fortune and becomes king by marrying a princess [L161]. Rich and mighty, he decides to return home. On the way he is held up by robbers (he gambles away all his belongings). His com- panions are all killed, and he himself escapes, but he has to aban- don his royal clothes. When he reaches his parents’ home in humble clothing [K1815], his father accuses him of lying and punishes and humiliates him (by forcing him to tend pigs, goats, sheep, geese). His wife (disguised as hermit, priest, bishop [K1837]) follows him, (overwhelms the robbers) and rescues him from the difficult situ- ation. He then puts on his royal clothes, returns home, and proves his royal identity to his parents
